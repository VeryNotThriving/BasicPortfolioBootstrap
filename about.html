                    I guess this is supposed to be a whole paragraph about me.
                    I'm currently going into senior year of highschool which feels like a lot considering how after this is college and being actually being an adult. If I ever have a ton of spare time I try to practice guitar. Somehow that hasn't really happened all that much. I know a little bit of html from a coding class in eigth grade and some Java from a class in my freashman year of highschool but I never really had much of a solid grasp of programming languages until this bootcamp. I have an interest in cybersecurity so I plan on trying to getting a job in that but thats thinking pretty far into the future. Until now I'm studying through specialized classes my highschool offers and by taking many computer science related classes.

                    This image is of my rat Darla when I was bringing her home in the carrier. She's got another friend at home but I don't any good pictures of her. On the topic of computer science related classes one of the main reasons for why I joined this bootcamp was to fufil that goal. Knowing how to understand how different programming langauges interact and function can be a large part of cybersecurity so this class has been valuable in teaching me html/css and javascript along with terminal commands.
